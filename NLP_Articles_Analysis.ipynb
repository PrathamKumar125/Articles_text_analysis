When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details.\\nAfter that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month.\\u00a0 We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user\\u2019s call records. For recent dates we used python\\u2019s datetime module which can easily identify recent date time.\\nProject Deliverables\\n2 python scripts\\n\\nfor fetching call details and converting into table format\\nfor identifying number of calls made and recent call timing\\u00a0\\n\\nTools used\\nVS Code, Google Drive, and MS Excel.\\nLanguage/techniques used\\nPython programming language, Data Analytics with numpy and pandas, python datetime.\\nSkills used\\nData Analytics,, Python, Mathematics\\nDatabases used\\nlocal data from MS Excel Sheet\\nWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution\\n\\nFirst one was the api data in json format with other unwanted data so it was a little difficult for us to identify the number of calls and other information from direct json data.\\nThe date format in the api data is not appropriate for us\\u00a0 to handle. Because the date is\\u00a0 stored in string format, it was difficult to compare dates with one another and identify recent ones.\\n\\nHow the Technical Challenges were Solved\\n\\nFor the first technical challenge we first took only useful details from api\\u2019s json format and converted these details in tabular format. In python we can easily handle tables with pandas dataframe and can apply whatever operation we want to collect details.\\nFor the second one we know that it would be difficult to handle dates in string format. So we first converted dates to a proper datetime format using python\\u2019s datetime module. It has a lot of built in functionalities which can easily compare dates with one another.\\u00a0 So from comparison we have identified recent dates of calls.\\n\\nProject Snapshots\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact Details\\nHere are my contact details:\\nEmail: ajay@blackcoffer.com\\nSkype: asbidyarthy\\nWhatsApp: +91 9717367468\\nTelegram: @asbidyarthy\\u00a0\\nFor project discussions and daily updates, would you like to use Slack, Skype, Telegram, or Whatsapp?

Project Description We needed to create an output video that will have the new lipsing according to the new replaced audio. Also we will have to change the actual audio with the new audio with automated editing. Our Solution We have created two different files which will perform 2 different operations 1st will replace the original audio with new and extract only video from original. 2nd will take the muted video and replaced audio and we will get the output of the new replaced audio lipsync.

Then we need to analyse all call logs and need to identify the number of calls made by a particular user to the company and the most recent call timing from the company server. Our Solution To fetch all call logs using zendesk api we used python language in programming. When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details. After that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month. We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user\\u2019s call records. For recent dates we used python\\u2019s datetime module which can easily identify recent date time. Project Deliverables 2 python scripts for fetching call details and converting into table format for identifying number of calls made and recent call timing Tools used VS Code, Google Drive, and MS Excel. Language/techniques used Python programming language, Data Analytics with numpy and pandas, python datetime. Skills used Data Analytics,, Python, Mathematics Databases used local data from MS Excel Sheet What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution First one was the api data in json format with other unwanted data so it was a little difficult for us to identify the number of calls and other information from direct json data. The date format in the api data is not appropriate for us to handle. Because the date is stored in string format, it was difficult to compare dates with one another and identify recent ones. How the Technical Challenges were Solved For the first technical challenge we first took only useful details from api\\u2019s json format and converted these details in tabular format. In python we can easily handle tables with pandas dataframe and can apply whatever operation we want to collect details. For the second one we know that it would be difficult to handle dates in string format. So we first converted dates to a proper datetime format using python\\u2019s datetime module. It has a lot of built in functionalities which can easily compare dates with one another. So from comparison we have identified recent dates of calls.

Project Description We needed to create an output video that will have the new lipsing according to the new replaced audio. Also we will have to change the actual audio with the new audio with automated editing. Our Solution We have created two different files which will perform 2 different operations 1st will replace the original audio with new and extract only video from original. 2nd will take the muted video and replaced audio and we will get the output of the new replaced audio lipsync.

Then we need to analyse all call logs and need to identify the number of calls made by a particular user to the company and the most recent call timing from the company server. Our Solution To fetch all call logs using zendesk api we used python language in programming. When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details. After that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month. We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user\\u2019s call records. For recent dates we used python\\u2019s datetime module which can easily identify recent date time. Project Deliverables 2 python scripts for fetching call details and converting into table format for identifying number of calls made and recent call timing Tools used VS Code, Google Drive, and MS Excel. Language/techniques used Python programming language, Data Analytics with numpy and pandas, python datetime. Skills used Data Analytics,, Python, Mathematics Databases used local data from MS Excel Sheet What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution First one was the api data in json format with other unwanted data so it was a little difficult for us to identify the number of calls and other information from direct json data. The date format in the api data is not appropriate for us to handle. Because the date is stored in string format, it was difficult to compare dates with one another and identify recent ones. How the Technical Challenges were Solved For the first technical challenge we first took only useful details from api\\u2019s json format and converted these details in tabular format. In python we can easily handle tables with pandas dataframe and can apply whatever operation we want to collect details. For the second one we know that it would be difficult to handle dates in string format. So we first converted dates to a proper datetime format using python\\u2019s datetime module. It has a lot of built in functionalities which can easily compare dates with one another. So from comparison we have identified recent dates of calls.

Project Description We needed to create an output video that will have the new lipsing according to the new replaced audio. Also we will have to change the actual audio with the new audio with automated editing. Our Solution We have created two different files which will perform 2 different operations 1st will replace the original audio with new and extract only video from original. 2nd will take the muted video and replaced audio and we will get the output of the new replaced audio lipsync.

Then we need to analyse all call logs and need to identify the number of calls made by a particular user to the company and the most recent call timing from the company server. Our Solution To fetch all call logs using zendesk api we used python language in programming. When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details. After that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month. We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user\\u2019s call records. For recent dates we used python\\u2019s datetime module which can easily identify recent date time. Project Deliverables 2 python scripts for fetching call details and converting into table format for identifying number of calls made and recent call timing Tools used VS Code, Google Drive, and MS Excel. Language/techniques used Python programming language, Data Analytics with numpy and pandas, python datetime. Skills used Data Analytics,, Python, Mathematics Databases used local data from MS Excel Sheet What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution First one was the api data in json format with other unwanted data so it was a little difficult for us to identify the number of calls and other information from direct json data. The date format in the api data is not appropriate for us to handle. Because the date is stored in string format, it was difficult to compare dates with one another and identify recent ones. How the Technical Challenges were Solved For the first technical challenge we first took only useful details from api\\u2019s json format and converted these details in tabular format. In python we can easily handle tables with pandas dataframe and can apply whatever operation we want to collect details. For the second one we know that it would be difficult to handle dates in string format. So we first converted dates to a proper datetime format using python\\u2019s datetime module. It has a lot of built in functionalities which can easily compare dates with one another. So from comparison we have identified recent dates of calls.

Project Description We needed to create an output video that will have the new lipsing according to the new replaced audio. Also we will have to change the actual audio with the new audio with automated editing. Our Solution We have created two different files which will perform 2 different operations 1st will replace the original audio with new and extract only video from original. 2nd will take the muted video and replaced audio and we will get the output of the new replaced audio lipsync.

Then we need to analyse all call logs and need to identify the number of calls made by a particular user to the company and the most recent call timing from the company server. Our Solution To fetch all call logs using zendesk api we used python language in programming. When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details. After that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month. We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user\\u2019s call records. For recent dates we used python\\u2019s datetime module which can easily identify recent date time. Project Deliverables 2 python scripts for fetching call details and converting into table format for identifying number of calls made and recent call timing Tools used VS Code, Google Drive, and MS Excel. Language/techniques used Python programming language, Data Analytics with numpy and pandas, python datetime. Skills used Data Analytics,, Python, Mathematics Databases used local data from MS Excel Sheet What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution First one was the api data in json format with other unwanted data so it was a little difficult for us to identify the number of calls and other information from direct json data. The date format in the api data is not appropriate for us to handle. Because the date is stored in string format, it was difficult to compare dates with one another and identify recent ones. How the Technical Challenges were Solved For the first technical challenge we first took only useful details from api\\u2019s json format and converted these details in tabular format. In python we can easily handle tables with pandas dataframe and can apply whatever operation we want to collect details. For the second one we know that it would be difficult to handle dates in string format. So we first converted dates to a proper datetime format using python\\u2019s datetime module. It has a lot of built in functionalities which can easily compare dates with one another. So from comparison we have identified recent dates of calls.

Project Description We needed to create an output video that will have the new lipsing according to the new replaced audio. Also we will have to change the actual audio with the new audio with automated editing. Our Solution We have created two different files which will perform 2 different operations 1st will replace the original audio with new and extract only video from original. 2nd will take the muted video and replaced audio and we will get the output of the new replaced audio lipsync.

Then we need to analyse all call logs and need to identify the number of calls made by a particular user to the company and the most recent call timing from the company server. Our Solution To fetch all call logs using zendesk api we used python language in programming. When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details. After that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month. We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user\\u2019s call records. For recent dates we used python\\u2019s datetime module which can easily identify recent date time. Project Deliverables 2 python scripts for fetching call details and converting into table format for identifying number of calls made and recent call timing Tools used VS Code, Google Drive, and MS Excel. Language/techniques used Python programming language, Data Analytics with numpy and pandas, python datetime. Skills used Data Analytics,, Python, Mathematics Databases used local data from MS Excel Sheet What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution First one was the api data in json format with other unwanted data so it was a little difficult for us to identify the number of calls and other information from direct json data. The date format in the api data is not appropriate for us to handle. Because the date is stored in string format, it was difficult to compare dates with one another and identify recent ones. How the Technical Challenges were Solved For the first technical challenge we first took only useful details from api\\u2019s json format and converted these details in tabular format. In python we can easily handle tables with pandas dataframe and can apply whatever operation we want to collect details. For the second one we know that it would be difficult to handle dates in string format. So we first converted dates to a proper datetime format using python\\u2019s datetime module. It has a lot of built in functionalities which can easily compare dates with one another. So from comparison we have identified recent dates of calls.

Project Description We needed to create an output video that will have the new lipsing according to the new replaced audio. Also we will have to change the actual audio with the new audio with automated editing. Our Solution We have created two different files which will perform 2 different operations 1st will replace the original audio with new and extract only video from original. 2nd will take the muted video and replaced audio and we will get the output of the new replaced audio lipsync.

Then we need to analyse all call logs and need to identify the number of calls made by a particular user to the company and the most recent call timing from the company server. Our Solution To fetch all call logs using zendesk api we used python language in programming. When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details. After that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month. We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user\\u2019s call records. For recent dates we used python\\u2019s datetime module which can easily identify recent date time. Project Deliverables 2 python scripts for fetching call details and converting into table format for identifying number of calls made and recent call timing Tools used VS Code, Google Drive, and MS Excel. Language/techniques used Python programming language, Data Analytics with numpy and pandas, python datetime. Skills used Data Analytics,, Python, Mathematics Databases used local data from MS Excel Sheet What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution First one was the api data in json format with other unwanted data so it was a little difficult for us to identify the number of calls and other information from direct json data. The date format in the api data is not appropriate for us to handle. Because the date is stored in string format, it was difficult to compare dates with one another and identify recent ones. How the Technical Challenges were Solved For the first technical challenge we first took only useful details from api\\u2019s json format and converted these details in tabular format. In python we can easily handle tables with pandas dataframe and can apply whatever operation we want to collect details. For the second one we know that it would be difficult to handle dates in string format. So we first converted dates to a proper datetime format using python\\u2019s datetime module. It has a lot of built in functionalities which can easily compare dates with one another. So from comparison we have identified recent dates of calls.

Project Description We needed to create an output video that will have the new lipsing according to the new replaced audio. Also we will have to change the actual audio with the new audio with automated editing. Our Solution We have created two different files which will perform 2 different operations 1st will replace the original audio with new and extract only video from original. 2nd will take the muted video and replaced audio and we will get the output of the new replaced audio lipsync.

Then we need to analyse all call logs and need to identify the number of calls made by a particular user to the company and the most recent call timing from the company server. Our Solution To fetch all call logs using zendesk api we used python language in programming. When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details. After that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month. We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user\\u2019s call records. For recent dates we used python\\u2019s datetime module which can easily identify recent date time. Project Deliverables 2 python scripts for fetching call details and converting into table format for identifying number of calls made and recent call timing Tools used VS Code, Google Drive, and MS Excel. Language/techniques used Python programming language, Data Analytics with numpy and pandas, python datetime. Skills used Data Analytics,, Python, Mathematics Databases used local data from MS Excel Sheet What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution First one was the api data in json format with other unwanted data so it was a little difficult for us to identify the number of calls and other information from direct json data. The date format in the api data is not appropriate for us to handle. Because the date is stored in string format, it was difficult to compare dates with one another and identify recent ones. How the Technical Challenges were Solved For the first technical challenge we first took only useful details from api\\u2019s json format and converted these details in tabular format. In python we can easily handle tables with pandas dataframe and can apply whatever operation we want to collect details. For the second one we know that it would be difficult to handle dates in string format. So we first converted dates to a proper datetime format using python\\u2019s datetime module. It has a lot of built in functionalities which can easily compare dates with one another. So from comparison we have identified recent dates of calls.

Then we need to analyse all call logs and need to identify the number of calls made by a particular user to the company and the most recent call timing from the company server. Our Solution To fetch all call logs using zendesk api we used python language in programming. When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details. After that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month. We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user\\u2019s call records. For recent dates we used python\\u2019s datetime module which can easily identify recent date time. Project Deliverables 2 python scripts for fetching call details and converting into table format for identifying number of calls made and recent call timing Tools used VS Code, Google Drive, and MS Excel. Language/techniques used Python programming language, Data Analytics with numpy and pandas, python datetime. Skills used Data Analytics,, Python, Mathematics Databases used local data from MS Excel Sheet What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution First one was the api data in json format with other unwanted data so it was a little difficult for us to identify the number of calls and other information from direct json data. The date format in the api data is not appropriate for us to handle. Because the date is stored in string format, it was difficult to compare dates with one another and identify recent ones. How the Technical Challenges were Solved For the first technical challenge we first took only useful details from api\\u2019s json format and converted these details in tabular format. In python we can easily handle tables with pandas dataframe and can apply whatever operation we want to collect details. For the second one we know that it would be difficult to handle dates in string format. So we first converted dates to a proper datetime format using python\\u2019s datetime module. It has a lot of built in functionalities which can easily compare dates with one another. So from comparison we have identified recent dates of calls.

Project Description We needed to create an output video that will have the new lipsing according to the new replaced audio. Also we will have to change the actual audio with the new audio with automated editing. Our Solution We have created two different files which will perform 2 different operations 1st will replace the original audio with new and extract only video from original. 2nd will take the muted video and replaced audio and we will get the output of the new replaced audio lipsync.

Then we need to analyse all call logs and need to identify the number of calls made by a particular user to the company and the most recent call timing from the company server. Our Solution To fetch all call logs using zendesk api we used python language in programming. When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details. After that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month. We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user\\u2019s call records. For recent dates we used python\\u2019s datetime module which can easily identify recent date time. Project Deliverables 2 python scripts for fetching call details and converting into table format for identifying number of calls made and recent call timing Tools used VS Code, Google Drive, and MS Excel. Language/techniques used Python programming language, Data Analytics with numpy and pandas, python datetime. Skills used Data Analytics,, Python, Mathematics Databases used local data from MS Excel Sheet What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution First one was the api data in json format with other unwanted data so it was a little difficult for us to identify the number of calls and other information from direct json data. The date format in the api data is not appropriate for us to handle. Because the date is stored in string format, it was difficult to compare dates with one another and identify recent ones. How the Technical Challenges were Solved For the first technical challenge we first took only useful details from api\\u2019s json format and converted these details in tabular format. In python we can easily handle tables with pandas dataframe and can apply whatever operation we want to collect details. For the second one we know that it would be difficult to handle dates in string format. So we first converted dates to a proper datetime format using python\\u2019s datetime module. It has a lot of built in functionalities which can easily compare dates with one another. So from comparison we have identified recent dates of calls.

Project Description We needed to create an output video that will have the new lipsing according to the new replaced audio. Also we will have to change the actual audio with the new audio with automated editing. Our Solution We have created two different files which will perform 2 different operations 1st will replace the original audio with new and extract only video from original. 2nd will take the muted video and replaced audio and we will get the output of the new replaced audio lipsync.

Then we need to analyse all call logs and need to identify the number of calls made by a particular user to the company and the most recent call timing from the company server. Our Solution To fetch all call logs using zendesk api we used python language in programming. When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details. After that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month. We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user\\u2019s call records. For recent dates we used python\\u2019s datetime module which can easily identify recent date time. Project Deliverables 2 python scripts for fetching call details and converting into table format for identifying number of calls made and recent call timing Tools used VS Code, Google Drive, and MS Excel. Language/techniques used Python programming language, Data Analytics with numpy and pandas, python datetime. Skills used Data Analytics,, Python, Mathematics Databases used local data from MS Excel Sheet What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution First one was the api data in json format with other unwanted data so it was a little difficult for us to identify the number of calls and other information from direct json data. The date format in the api data is not appropriate for us to handle. Because the date is stored in string format, it was difficult to compare dates with one another and identify recent ones. How the Technical Challenges were Solved For the first technical challenge we first took only useful details from api\\u2019s json format and converted these details in tabular format. In python we can easily handle tables with pandas dataframe and can apply whatever operation we want to collect details. For the second one we know that it would be difficult to handle dates in string format. So we first converted dates to a proper datetime format using python\\u2019s datetime module. It has a lot of built in functionalities which can easily compare dates with one another. So from comparison we have identified recent dates of calls.

Project Description We needed to create an output video that will have the new lipsing according to the new replaced audio. Also we will have to change the actual audio with the new audio with automated editing. Our Solution We have created two different files which will perform 2 different operations 1st will replace the original audio with new and extract only video from original. 2nd will take the muted video and replaced audio and we will get the output of the new replaced audio lipsync.

Then we need to analyse all call logs and need to identify the number of calls made by a particular user to the company and the most recent call timing from the company server. Our Solution To fetch all call logs using zendesk api we used python language in programming. When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details. After that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month. We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user\\u2019s call records. For recent dates we used python\\u2019s datetime module which can easily identify recent date time. Project Deliverables 2 python scripts for fetching call details and converting into table format for identifying number of calls made and recent call timing Tools used VS Code, Google Drive, and MS Excel. Language/techniques used Python programming language, Data Analytics with numpy and pandas, python datetime. Skills used Data Analytics,, Python, Mathematics Databases used local data from MS Excel Sheet What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution First one was the api data in json format with other unwanted data so it was a little difficult for us to identify the number of calls and other information from direct json data. The date format in the api data is not appropriate for us to handle. Because the date is stored in string format, it was difficult to compare dates with one another and identify recent ones. How the Technical Challenges were Solved For the first technical challenge we first took only useful details from api\\u2019s json format and converted these details in tabular format. In python we can easily handle tables with pandas dataframe and can apply whatever operation we want to collect details. For the second one we know that it would be difficult to handle dates in string format. So we first converted dates to a proper datetime format using python\\u2019s datetime module. It has a lot of built in functionalities which can easily compare dates with one another. So from comparison we have identified recent dates of calls.
